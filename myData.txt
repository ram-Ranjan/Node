Welcome to NodeJs File Handling!!

1.Whenever a user clicks on a url or click on search button a request is generated which goes to the server via internet and server gives back data in the form of response to the client.

 When a user clicks a URL or search button, a request is generated by their browser.

 This request is an HTTP request, containing a header (with metadata about the request) and sometimes a body.

 This request is then send to isp fron local network and isp does dns lookup and generator ip address for the given url. The request is then routed to the server mostly via optical fibers. The server generates a response based on request and transmits it back to the isp and then to local network.Finally the response reaches the required user and response is rendered accordingly in the browser.

In this whole back and forth ip address plays an important role in send and receiving data.



2.Node.js comes with several core modules that are part of its standard library. These modules provide various functionalities that help in building server-side applications. Some of the common modules are :

http, fs, path,os, events, stream.





3. http module is used to create and manage servers in nodejs. It allows you to define request and response object and handle them. Whenever a request is processed , the appropriate content is sent back to the client based on request details.

ex: http.createServer((req,res) => {

}

);



fs module is used to do file handling with the help of nodejs, where we can read from file by using `fs.readFileSync` and write in files using `fs.writeFileSync` by passing the file path and content sychronously.

fs module allows both synchronous and asynchronous file handling.

fs.writeFileSync(path,content);







path module provide utilities for working with the file and directorie paths.

path.join__dirname,'example', 'file.txt');





os module provides operating system-related utility methods and properties.

It allows to fetch info about os hostname, platform and available memory.

os.platform()

os.totalmem()



events module is used to handle event driven programming in node js.

It provides EventEmitter class that is used to create,fire and listen for custom events.



const EventEmitter = require('events');



const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();



eventEmitter.on('greet',() => {

console.log("Event getting emitted");

});

eventEmitter.emit("greet");



stream module is used to treat data as stream of tokens usually for larger data which can be passed in the form of chunks.








4.An absolute path is the complete path to a file or folder from the root directory. It starts from the root directory and specifies each directory along the way to the target file or folder. This path is unique and does not depend on the current working directory.

A relative path specifies the location of a file or folder in relation to the current working directory. It does not start from the root directory but from the current location, making it dependent on where you currently are in the directory structure.



5.The createServer function in the http module of Node.js is used to create an HTTP server instance. It takes a callback function as an argument, which gets invoked every time a request is made to the server. This callback function typically takes two arguments: request and response, representing the incoming HTTP request and the server's response to that request, respectively. 



6.Anonymous functions or lambda functions, are functions that are defined without a name. Instead of declaring a function with a name, you define it directly where it's needed, often as an argument to other functions or as part of an expression.



7.The server.listen() method in Node.js is used to start the server and make it listen for incoming connections on a specified port and optional hostname. When you call server.listen(), the server begins to accept and handle incoming requests based on the logic defined in the request handler function.



8 1.

const http = require('http');

const server =http.createServer((req,res) => {

    console.log("Ranjan Kumar")

})

server.listen(4000)



2.

const http = require('http');





const server =http.createServer((req,res) => {

    // console.log(res)

    // console.log(res.statusCode)

    //console.log("Ranjan Kumar")



    //Sending a response back to the browser

    //step 1 - setHeader with what type of data to pass

    res.setHeader('Content-Type','text/plain');

    //step 2 - write('The content')

    res.write("Hello , Ranjan!!!!!!!");

    //step 3 Ending with end()

    res.end();



})



server.listen(4000,'localhost',() => {

    console.log(`Listening for requests on port 4000`)

});

In this whole back and forth ip address plays an important role in send and receiving data.



2.Node.js comes with several core modules that are part of its standard library. These modules provide various functionalities that help in building server-side applications. Some of the common modules are :

http, fs, path,os, events, stream.





3. http module is used to create and manage servers in nodejs. It allows you to define request and response object and handle them. Whenever a request is processed , the appropriate content is sent back to the client based on request details.

ex: http.createServer((req,res) => {

}

);



fs module is used to do file handling with the help of nodejs, where we can read from file by using `fs.readFileSync` and write in files using `fs.writeFileSync` by passing the file path and content sychronously.

fs module allows both synchronous and asynchronous file handling.

fs.writeFileSync(path,content);







path module provide utilities for working with the file and directorie paths.

path.join__dirname,'example', 'file.txt');





os module provides operating system-related utility methods and properties.

It allows to fetch info about os hostname, platform and available memory.

os.platform()

os.totalmem()



events module is used to handle event driven programming in node js.

It provides EventEmitter class that is used to create,fire and listen for custom events.



const EventEmitter = require('events');



const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();



eventEmitter.on('greet',() => {

console.log("Event getting emitted");

});

eventEmitter.emit("greet");



stream module is used to treat data as stream of tokens usually for larger data which can be passed in the form of chunks.








4.An absolute path is the complete path to a file or folder from the root directory. It starts from the root directory and specifies each directory along the way to the target file or folder. This path is unique and does not depend on the current working directory.

A relative path specifies the location of a file or folder in relation to the current working directory. It does not start from the root directory but from the current location, making it dependent on where you currently are in the directory structure.



5.The createServer function in the http module of Node.js is used to create an HTTP server instance. It takes a callback function as an argument, which gets invoked every time a request is made to the server. This callback function typically takes two arguments: request and response, representing the incoming HTTP request and the server's response to that request, respectively. 



6.Anonymous functions or lambda functions, are functions that are defined without a name. Instead of declaring a function with a name, you define it directly where it's needed, often as an argument to other functions or as part of an expression.



7.The server.listen() method in Node.js is used to start the server and make it listen for incoming connections on a specified port and optional hostname. When you call server.listen(), the server begins to accept and handle incoming requests based on the logic defined in the request handler function.

    //Sending a response back to the browser

    //step 1 - setHeader with what type of data to pass

    res.setHeader('Content-Type','text/plain');

    //step 2 - write('The content')

    res.write("Hello , Ranjan!!!!!!!");

    //step 3 Ending with end()

    res.end();



})



server.listen(4000,'localhost',() => {

    console.log(`Listening for requests on port 4000`)

});

3. http module is used to create and manage servers in nodejs. It allows you to define request and response object and handle them. Whenever a request is processed , the appropriate content is sent back to the client based on request details.

ex: http.createServer((req,res) => {

}

);



fs module is used to do file handling with the help of nodejs, where we can read from file by using `fs.readFileSync` and write in files using `fs.writeFileSync` by passing the file path and content sychronously.

fs module allows both synchronous and asynchronous file handling.

fs.writeFileSync(path,content);







path module provide utilities for working with the file and directorie paths.

path.join__dirname,'example', 'file.txt');





os module provides operating system-related utility methods and properties.

It allows to fetch info about os hostname, platform and available memory.

os.platform()

os.totalmem()



events module is used to handle event driven programming in node js.

It provides EventEmitter class that is used to create,fire and listen for custom events.



const EventEmitter = require('events');



const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();



eventEmitter.on('greet',() => {

console.log("Event getting emitted");

});

eventEmitter.emit("greet");



stream module is used to treat data as stream of tokens usually for larger data which can be passed in the form of chunks.








4.An absolute path is the complete path to a file or folder from the root directory. It starts from the root directory and specifies each directory along the way to the target file or folder. This path is unique and does not depend on the current working directory.

A relative path specifies the location of a file or folder in relation to the current working directory. It does not start from the root directory but from the current location, making it dependent on where you currently are in the directory structure.



5.The createServer function in the http module of Node.js is used to create an HTTP server instance. It takes a callback function as an argument, which gets invoked every time a request is made to the server. This callback function typically takes two arguments: request and response, representing the incoming HTTP request and the server's response to that request, respectively. 



6.Anonymous functions or lambda functions, are functions that are defined without a name. Instead of declaring a function with a name, you define it directly where it's needed, often as an argument to other functions or as part of an expression.



7.The server.listen() method in Node.js is used to start the server and make it listen for incoming connections on a specified port and optional hostname. When you call server.listen(), the server begins to accept and handle incoming requests based on the logic defined in the request handler function.



8 1.

const http = require('http');

const server =http.createServer((req,res) => {

    console.log("Ranjan Kumar")

})

server.listen(4000)



2.

const http = require('http');





const server =http.createServer((req,res) => {

    // console.log(res)

    // console.log(res.statusCode)

    //console.log("Ranjan Kumar")



    //Sending a response back to the browser

    //step 1 - setHeader with what type of data to pass

    res.setHeader('Content-Type','text/plain');

    //step 2 - write('The content')

    res.write("Hello , Ranjan!!!!!!!");

    //step 3 Ending with end()

    res.end();



})



server.listen(4000,'localhost',() => {

    console.log(`Listening for requests on port 4000`)

});

1.Whenever a user clicks on a url or click on search button a request is generated which goes to the server via internet and server gives back data in the form of response to the client.

 When a user clicks a URL or search button, a request is generated by their browser.

 This request is an HTTP request, containing a header (with metadata about the request) and sometimes a body.

 This request is then send to isp fron local network and isp does dns lookup and generator ip address for the given url. The request is then routed to the server mostly via optical fibers. The server generates a response based on request and transmits it back to the isp and then to local network.Finally the response reaches the required user and response is rendered accordingly in the browser.

In this whole back and forth ip address plays an important role in send and receiving data.

fs module is used to do file handling with the help of nodejs, where we can read from file by using `fs.readFileSync` and write in files using `fs.writeFileSync` by passing the file path and content sychronously.

fs module allows both synchronous and asynchronous file handling.

fs.writeFileSync(path,content);







path module provide utilities for working with the file and directorie paths.

path.join__dirname,'example', 'file.txt');





os module provides operating system-related utility methods and properties.

It allows to fetch info about os hostname, platform and available memory.

os.platform()

os.totalmem()



events module is used to handle event driven programming in node js.

It provides EventEmitter class that is used to create,fire and listen for custom events.



const EventEmitter = require('events');



const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();



eventEmitter.on('greet',() => {

console.log("Event getting emitted");

});

eventEmitter.emit("greet");



stream module is used to treat data as stream of tokens usually for larger data which can be passed in the form of chunks.








4.An absolute path is the complete path to a file or folder from the root directory. It starts from the root directory and specifies each directory along the way to the target file or folder. This path is unique and does not depend on the current working directory.

A relative path specifies the location of a file or folder in relation to the current working directory. It does not start from the root directory but from the current location, making it dependent on where you currently are in the directory structure.



5.The createServer function in the http module of Node.js is used to create an HTTP server instance. It takes a callback function as an argument, which gets invoked every time a request is made to the server. This callback function typically takes two arguments: request and response, representing the incoming HTTP request and the server's response to that request, respectively. 



6.Anonymous functions or lambda functions, are functions that are defined without a name. Instead of declaring a function with a name, you define it directly where it's needed, often as an argument to other functions or as part of an expression.



7.The server.listen() method in Node.js is used to start the server and make it listen for incoming connections on a specified port and optional hostname. When you call server.listen(), the server begins to accept and handle incoming requests based on the logic defined in the request handler function.

1.Whenever a user clicks on a url or click on search button a request is generated which goes to the server via internet and server gives back data in the form of response to the client.

 When a user clicks a URL or search button, a request is generated by their browser.

 This request is an HTTP request, containing a header (with metadata about the request) and sometimes a body.

 This request is then send to isp fron local network and isp does dns lookup and generator ip address for the given url. The request is then routed to the server mostly via optical fibers. The server generates a response based on request and transmits it back to the isp and then to local network.Finally the response reaches the required user and response is rendered accordingly in the browser.

In this whole back and forth ip address plays an important role in send and receiving data.



2.Node.js comes with several core modules that are part of its standard library. These modules provide various functionalities that help in building server-side applications. Some of the common modules are :

http, fs, path,os, events, stream.





3. http module is used to create and manage servers in nodejs. It allows you to define request and response object and handle them. Whenever a request is processed , the appropriate content is sent back to the client based on request details.

ex: http.createServer((req,res) => {

It provides EventEmitter class that is used to create,fire and listen for custom events.



const EventEmitter = require('events');



const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();



eventEmitter.on('greet',() => {

console.log("Event getting emitted");

});

eventEmitter.emit("greet");



stream module is used to treat data as stream of tokens usually for larger data which can be passed in the form of chunks.








4.An absolute path is the complete path to a file or folder from the root directory. It starts from the root directory and specifies each directory along the way to the target file or folder. This path is unique and does not depend on the current working directory.

A relative path specifies the location of a file or folder in relation to the current working directory. It does not start from the root directory but from the current location, making it dependent on where you currently are in the directory structure.



5.The createServer function in the http module of Node.js is used to create an HTTP server instance. It takes a callback function as an argument, which gets invoked every time a request is made to the server. This callback function typically takes two arguments: request and response, representing the incoming HTTP request and the server's response to that request, respectively. 



6.Anonymous functions or lambda functions, are functions that are defined without a name. Instead of declaring a function with a name, you define it directly where it's needed, often as an argument to other functions or as part of an expression.



7.The server.listen() method in Node.js is used to start the server and make it listen for incoming connections on a specified port and optional hostname. When you call server.listen(), the server begins to accept and handle incoming requests based on the logic defined in the request handler function.

const http = require('http');

const server =http.createServer((req,res) => {

    console.log("Ranjan Kumar")

})

server.listen(4000)



2.

const http = require('http');





const server =http.createServer((req,res) => {

    // console.log(res)

    // console.log(res.statusCode)

    //console.log("Ranjan Kumar")



    //Sending a response back to the browser

    //step 1 - setHeader with what type of data to pass

    res.setHeader('Content-Type','text/plain');

    //step 2 - write('The content')

    res.write("Hello , Ranjan!!!!!!!");

    //step 3 Ending with end()

    res.end();



})



server.listen(4000,'localhost',() => {

    console.log(`Listening for requests on port 4000`)

});

1.Whenever a user clicks on a url or click on search button a request is generated which goes to the server via internet and server gives back data in the form of response to the client.

 When a user clicks a URL or search button, a request is generated by their browser.

 This request is an HTTP request, containing a header (with metadata about the request) and sometimes a body.

 This request is then send to isp fron local network and isp does dns lookup and generator ip address for the given url. The request is then routed to the server mostly via optical fibers. The server generates a response based on request and transmits it back to the isp and then to local network.Finally the response reaches the required user and response is rendered accordingly in the browser.

In this whole back and forth ip address plays an important role in send and receiving data.



2.Node.js comes with several core modules that are part of its standard library. These modules provide various functionalities that help in building server-side applications. Some of the common modules are :

http, fs, path,os, events, stream.





3. http module is used to create and manage servers in nodejs. It allows you to define request and response object and handle them. Whenever a request is processed , the appropriate content is sent back to the client based on request details.

ex: http.createServer((req,res) => {

}

);



fs module is used to do file handling with the help of nodejs, where we can read from file by using `fs.readFileSync` and write in files using `fs.writeFileSync` by passing the file path and content sychronously.

fs module allows both synchronous and asynchronous file handling.

fs.writeFileSync(path,content);







path module provide utilities for working with the file and directorie paths.

path.join__dirname,'example', 'file.txt');





os module provides operating system-related utility methods and properties.

It allows to fetch info about os hostname, platform and available memory.

os.platform()

os.totalmem()



events module is used to handle event driven programming in node js.

It provides EventEmitter class that is used to create,fire and listen for custom events.



const EventEmitter = require('events');



const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();



eventEmitter.on('greet',() => {

console.log("Event getting emitted");

});

eventEmitter.emit("greet");

4.An absolute path is the complete path to a file or folder from the root directory. It starts from the root directory and specifies each directory along the way to the target file or folder. This path is unique and does not depend on the current working directory.

A relative path specifies the location of a file or folder in relation to the current working directory. It does not start from the root directory but from the current location, making it dependent on where you currently are in the directory structure.



5.The createServer function in the http module of Node.js is used to create an HTTP server instance. It takes a callback function as an argument, which gets invoked every time a request is made to the server. This callback function typically takes two arguments: request and response, representing the incoming HTTP request and the server's response to that request, respectively. 



6.Anonymous functions or lambda functions, are functions that are defined without a name. Instead of declaring a function with a name, you define it directly where it's needed, often as an argument to other functions or as part of an expression.



7.The server.listen() method in Node.js is used to start the server and make it listen for incoming connections on a specified port and optional hostname. When you call server.listen(), the server begins to accept and handle incoming requests based on the logic defined in the request handler function.

const server =http.createServer((req,res) => {

    // console.log(res)

    // console.log(res.statusCode)

    //console.log("Ranjan Kumar")



    //Sending a response back to the browser

    //step 1 - setHeader with what type of data to pass

    res.setHeader('Content-Type','text/plain');

    //step 2 - write('The content')

1.Whenever a user clicks on a url or click on search button a request is generated which goes to the server via internet and server gives back data in the form of response to the client.

 When a user clicks a URL or search button, a request is generated by their browser.

 This request is an HTTP request, containing a header (with metadata about the request) and sometimes a body.

 This request is then send to isp fron local network and isp does dns lookup and generator ip address for the given url. The request is then routed to the server mostly via optical fibers. The server generates a response based on request and transmits it back to the isp and then to local network.Finally the response reaches the required user and response is rendered accordingly in the browser.

In this whole back and forth ip address plays an important role in send and receiving data.



2.Node.js comes with several core modules that are part of its standard library. These modules provide various functionalities that help in building server-side applications. Some of the common modules are :

http, fs, path,os, events, stream.





3. http module is used to create and manage servers in nodejs. It allows you to define request and response object and handle them. Whenever a request is processed , the appropriate content is sent back to the client based on request details.

ex: http.createServer((req,res) => {

}

);



fs module is used to do file handling with the help of nodejs, where we can read from file by using `fs.readFileSync` and write in files using `fs.writeFileSync` by passing the file path and content sychronously.

fs module allows both synchronous and asynchronous file handling.

fs.writeFileSync(path,content);







path module provide utilities for working with the file and directorie paths.

path.join__dirname,'example', 'file.txt');





os module provides operating system-related utility methods and properties.

It allows to fetch info about os hostname, platform and available memory.

os.platform()

os.totalmem()



events module is used to handle event driven programming in node js.

It provides EventEmitter class that is used to create,fire and listen for custom events.



const EventEmitter = require('events');



const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();



eventEmitter.on('greet',() => {

console.log("Event getting emitted");

});

eventEmitter.emit("greet");

It takes a callback function as an argument, which gets invoked every time a request is made to the server. This callback function typically takes two arguments: request and response, representing the incoming HTTP request and the server's response to that request, respectively. 



6.Anonymous functions or lambda functions, are functions that are defined without a name. Instead of declaring a function with a name, you define it directly where it's needed, often as an argument to other functions or as part of an expression.



7.The server.listen() method in Node.js is used to start the server and make it listen for incoming connections on a specified port and optional hostname. When you call server.listen(), the server begins to accept and handle incoming requests based on the logic defined in the request handler function.

1.Whenever a user clicks on a url or click on search button a request is generated which goes to the server via internet and server gives back data in the form of response to the client.

 When a user clicks a URL or search button, a request is generated by their browser.

 This request is an HTTP request, containing a header (with metadata about the request) and sometimes a body.

 This request is then send to isp fron local network and isp does dns lookup and generator ip address for the given url. The request is then routed to the server mostly via optical fibers. The server generates a response based on request and transmits it back to the isp and then to local network.Finally the response reaches the required user and response is rendered accordingly in the browser.

In this whole back and forth ip address plays an important role in send and receiving data.



2.Node.js comes with several core modules that are part of its standard library. These modules provide various functionalities that help in building server-side applications. Some of the common modules are :

http, fs, path,os, events, stream.





3. http module is used to create and manage servers in nodejs. It allows you to define request and response object and handle them. Whenever a request is processed , the appropriate content is sent back to the client based on request details.

ex: http.createServer((req,res) => {

}

);



fs module is used to do file handling with the help of nodejs, where we can read from file by using `fs.readFileSync` and write in files using `fs.writeFileSync` by passing the file path and content sychronously.

fs module allows both synchronous and asynchronous file handling.

fs.writeFileSync(path,content);







path module provide utilities for working with the file and directorie paths.

path.join__dirname,'example', 'file.txt');





os module provides operating system-related utility methods and properties.

It allows to fetch info about os hostname, platform and available memory.

os.platform()

os.totalmem()



events module is used to handle event driven programming in node js.

It provides EventEmitter class that is used to create,fire and listen for custom events.



const EventEmitter = require('events');



const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();



eventEmitter.on('greet',() => {

console.log("Event getting emitted");

});

eventEmitter.emit("greet");



stream module is used to treat data as stream of tokens usually for larger data which can be passed in the form of chunks.








4.An absolute path is the complete path to a file or folder from the root directory. It starts from the root directory and specifies each directory along the way to the target file or folder. This path is unique and does not depend on the current working directory.

6.Anonymous functions or lambda functions, are functions that are defined without a name. Instead of declaring a function with a name, you define it directly where it's needed, often as an argument to other functions or as part of an expression.



7.The server.listen() method in Node.js is used to start the server and make it listen for incoming connections on a specified port and optional hostname. When you call server.listen(), the server begins to accept and handle incoming requests based on the logic defined in the request handler function.

1.Whenever a user clicks on a url or click on search button a request is generated which goes to the server via internet and server gives back data in the form of response to the client.

 When a user clicks a URL or search button, a request is generated by their browser.

 This request is an HTTP request, containing a header (with metadata about the request) and sometimes a body.

 This request is then send to isp fron local network and isp does dns lookup and generator ip address for the given url. The request is then routed to the server mostly via optical fibers. The server generates a response based on request and transmits it back to the isp and then to local network.Finally the response reaches the required user and response is rendered accordingly in the browser.

In this whole back and forth ip address plays an important role in send and receiving data.



2.Node.js comes with several core modules that are part of its standard library. These modules provide various functionalities that help in building server-side applications. Some of the common modules are :

http, fs, path,os, events, stream.





3. http module is used to create and manage servers in nodejs. It allows you to define request and response object and handle them. Whenever a request is processed , the appropriate content is sent back to the client based on request details.

ex: http.createServer((req,res) => {

}

);



fs module is used to do file handling with the help of nodejs, where we can read from file by using `fs.readFileSync` and write in files using `fs.writeFileSync` by passing the file path and content sychronously.

fs module allows both synchronous and asynchronous file handling.

fs.writeFileSync(path,content);







path module provide utilities for working with the file and directorie paths.

path.join__dirname,'example', 'file.txt');





os module provides operating system-related utility methods and properties.

It allows to fetch info about os hostname, platform and available memory.

os.platform()

os.totalmem()



events module is used to handle event driven programming in node js.

It provides EventEmitter class that is used to create,fire and listen for custom events.



const EventEmitter = require('events');



const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();



eventEmitter.on('greet',() => {

console.log("Event getting emitted");

});

eventEmitter.emit("greet");



stream module is used to treat data as stream of tokens usually for larger data which can be passed in the form of chunks.








4.An absolute path is the complete path to a file or folder from the root directory. It starts from the root directory and specifies each directory along the way to the target file or folder. This path is unique and does not depend on the current working directory.

A relative path specifies the location of a file or folder in relation to the current working directory. It does not start from the root directory but from the current location, making it dependent on where you currently are in the directory structure.

8 1.

const http = require('http');

const server =http.createServer((req,res) => {

    console.log("Ranjan Kumar")

})

server.listen(4000)



2.

const http = require('http');





const server =http.createServer((req,res) => {

    // console.log(res)

    // console.log(res.statusCode)

    //console.log("Ranjan Kumar")



    //Sending a response back to the browser

    //step 1 - setHeader with what type of data to pass

    res.setHeader('Content-Type','text/plain');

    //step 2 - write('The content')

    res.write("Hello , Ranjan!!!!!!!");

    //step 3 Ending with end()

    res.end();



})



server.listen(4000,'localhost',() => {

    console.log(`Listening for requests on port 4000`)

});

1.Whenever a user clicks on a url or click on search button a request is generated which goes to the server via internet and server gives back data in the form of response to the client.

 When a user clicks a URL or search button, a request is generated by their browser.

 This request is an HTTP request, containing a header (with metadata about the request) and sometimes a body.

 This request is then send to isp fron local network and isp does dns lookup and generator ip address for the given url. The request is then routed to the server mostly via optical fibers. The server generates a response based on request and transmits it back to the isp and then to local network.Finally the response reaches the required user and response is rendered accordingly in the browser.

In this whole back and forth ip address plays an important role in send and receiving data.



2.Node.js comes with several core modules that are part of its standard library. These modules provide various functionalities that help in building server-side applications. Some of the common modules are :

http, fs, path,os, events, stream.





3. http module is used to create and manage servers in nodejs. It allows you to define request and response object and handle them. Whenever a request is processed , the appropriate content is sent back to the client based on request details.

ex: http.createServer((req,res) => {

}

);



fs module is used to do file handling with the help of nodejs, where we can read from file by using `fs.readFileSync` and write in files using `fs.writeFileSync` by passing the file path and content sychronously.

fs module allows both synchronous and asynchronous file handling.

fs.writeFileSync(path,content);







path module provide utilities for working with the file and directorie paths.

path.join__dirname,'example', 'file.txt');





os module provides operating system-related utility methods and properties.

It allows to fetch info about os hostname, platform and available memory.

os.platform()

os.totalmem()



events module is used to handle event driven programming in node js.

It provides EventEmitter class that is used to create,fire and listen for custom events.



const EventEmitter = require('events');



const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();



eventEmitter.on('greet',() => {

console.log("Event getting emitted");

});

eventEmitter.emit("greet");



stream module is used to treat data as stream of tokens usually for larger data which can be passed in the form of chunks.








4.An absolute path is the complete path to a file or folder from the root directory. It starts from the root directory and specifies each directory along the way to the target file or folder. This path is unique and does not depend on the current working directory.

A relative path specifies the location of a file or folder in relation to the current working directory. It does not start from the root directory but from the current location, making it dependent on where you currently are in the directory structure.



5.The createServer function in the http module of Node.js is used to create an HTTP server instance. It takes a callback function as an argument, which gets invoked every time a request is made to the server. This callback function typically takes two arguments: request and response, representing the incoming HTTP request and the server's response to that request, respectively. 



6.Anonymous functions or lambda functions, are functions that are defined without a name. Instead of declaring a function with a name, you define it directly where it's needed, often as an argument to other functions or as part of an expression.
